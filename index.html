    <p>
      The U.S. national government is a presidential constitutional federal republic and liberal democracy with three separate 
      branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature 
      composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, 
      an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Substantial autonomy is provided by federalism, 
      with a political culture promoting liberty, equality, individualism, personal autonomy, and limited government.
  
      One of the world's most developed countries, the United States has had the largest nominal 
      GDP since about 1890 and accounted for over 15% of the global economy in 2023.[l] 
      It possesses by far the largest amount of wealth of any country and has the highest disposable household 
      income per capita among OECD countries. The U.S. ranks among the world's highest 
      in economic competitiveness, productivity, innovation, human rights, 
      and higher education. Its hard power and cultural influence have a global reach. The U.S. is a founding member of the World Bank, 
      Organization of American States, NATO, and United Nations,[m] as well as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

        The United States shares land borders with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south, a territorial water border with Russia in
        the northwest, 
       and two territorial water borders in the southeast between Florida and Cuba, and Florida and the Bahamas. 
       The contiguous 48 states are otherwise bounded by the Pacific Ocean on the west, the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast. 
       Alaska borders the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest, the Bering Strait to the west, and the Arctic Ocean to the north; 
       Hawaii lies far to the southwest of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.

       Forty-eight of the states are in the single region between Canada and Mexico. This group is referred to, with varying precision 
       and formality, as the contiguous United States, and as the "Lower 48". Alaska, which is included in the term "continental United States", is located at the northwestern end of North America.
       
       The nation's capital city, Washington, D.C., was established in 1800 after being relocated there from Philadelphia. 
       It was established as a federal district located on land donated by the state of Maryland; Virginia also donated land, 
       but it was returned in 1849. The United States also has overseas territories with varying levels of autonomy and organization, 
       including the Caribbean territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, formerly known as the Danish Virgin Islands 
       and purchased by the United States at the beginning of World War II, the Pacific territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Northern 
       Mariana Islands, and several uninhabited island territories. Some of the territories acquired were part 
       of the territorial evolution of the United States or a product of the nation's effort to gain access to the east.
       
       Nearly all of the United States is in the Northern Hemisphere with the exception of American Samoa and Jarvis Island.

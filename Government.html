    <p>
      The legislative branch of the United States government is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, which together 
      form Congress. The legislative branch is responsible for making laws, declaring war, and regulating commerce. 
The legislative branch has many responsibilities, including:
Making laws: Congress proposes new laws, called bills, which must pass both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The President can then sign the bill into law, veto it, or make changes and send it back to Congress. 
Declaring war: Congress has the power to declare war. 
Confirming or rejecting presidential nominations: Congress can confirm or reject presidential nominations for federal judges, heads of federal agencies, and the Supreme Court. 
Oversight of the executive branch: Congress oversees the executive branch. 
Funding government programs: Congress funds government programs and functions. 
Holding hearings: Congress holds hearings to inform the legislative process. 
The legislative branch is established in Article I of the Constitution.

      <p>
        The executive branch of the United States government is responsible for enforcing the laws of the land. It includes: 
        The President
        The head of state and leader of the federal government. The president is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws, and appoints the heads of federal agencies. The president also represents the United States in discussions with other nations, and leads the nation in times of war. 
        The Vice President
        Supports the president and becomes president if the president is unable to serve. The vice president also presides over the U.S. Senate and breaks ties in Senate votes. 
        The Cabinet
        A group of advisors to the president that includes the vice president, heads of executive departments, and other high-ranking government officials. Cabinet members are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate. 
        Independent federal agencies and commissions
        These agencies have a variety of missions and responsibilities, such as the Department of Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Social Security Administration, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
        The Executive Office of the President
        Located in the White House.

      <h1 id="Judicial">Judicial</h1>
      <p>
        The judicial branch of the United States government has several functions, including:
        Interpreting laws: The judicial branch interprets the meaning of laws. 
        Applying laws: The judicial branch applies laws to specific cases. 
        Deciding constitutionality: The judicial branch determines if federal laws are constitutional. This power is known as judicial review, and the Supreme Court established it in the 1803 case Marbury v. Madison. 
        Resolving disputes: The judicial branch resolves disputes about federal laws. 
        The judicial branch is independent from the other branches of government, but it does rely on the executive and legislative branches for enforcement. For example, the president appoints federal judges with the consent of the Senate, and the executive branch enforces court decisions. 
        The judicial branch's independence is important because it protects the minority from the majority, the poor from the rich, and citizens from government excesses.
